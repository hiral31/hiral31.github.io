        <p>Swedish colonists built <strong>Nyenskans</strong>, a fortress at the mouth of the <strong> Neva River </strong> in <em>1611</em>, in what was then called <strong>Ingermanland </strong>, which was inhabited by <strong> Finnic</strong> tribe of <strong>Ingrians </strong>. The small town of Nyen grew up around it.
</p><p>
At the end of the <em>17th century </em>, Peter the Great, who was very interested in seafaring and maritime affairs, wanted Russia to gain a seaport in order to trade with the rest of Europe. He needed a better seaport than the country's main one at the time,<strong>Arkhangelsk </strong>, which was on the <strong>White Sea </strong> in the far north and closed to shipping during the winter.</p>

            By the <em>1840</em>s, neoclassical architecture had given way to various romanticist styles, which dominated until the <em>1890</em>s, represented by such architects as<strong> Andrei Stackenschneider (Mariinsky Palace, Beloselsky-Belozersky Palace, Nicholas Palace, New Michael Palace) </strong>and<strong> Konstantin Thon (Moskovsky railway station)</strong>.
